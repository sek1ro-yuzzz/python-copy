                      * **distance_squared**: The squared neighbor distance.
                      * **delta**: The three-dimensional vector connecting the central particle with the current neighbor (correctly taking into account periodic boundary conditions).
                      * **idealvec**: The ideal lattice vector corresponding to the current neighbor, expressed in the coordinate frame of the PTM template structure.
