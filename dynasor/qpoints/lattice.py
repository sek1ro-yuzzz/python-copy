    def __init__(self, primitive: NDArray, supercell: NDArray):
        """Representation of a crystal supercell

        The supercell S is given by the primitive cell p and a repetition
        matrix P such that:

            dot(P, p) = S

        In this convention the cell vectors are row vectors of p and S as in
        ASE. An inverse cell is defined as:

            c_inv = inv(c).T

        and the reciprocal cell is defined as:

            c_rec = 2*pi*inv(c).T

        Notice that the inverse cell here is defined with the tranpose so that
        the lattic vectors of the inverse/reciprocal lattice are also row
        vectors. The above also implies:

            dot(P.T, S_inv) = p_inv

        The inverse supercell S_inv defines a new lattice in reciprocal space.
        Those inverse lattice points which resides inside the inverse primitive
        cell p_inv are called commensurate lattice points. These are typically
        the only points of interest in MD simulations from a crystallographic
        and lattice dynamics point of view.

        The convention taken here is that the reciprocal cell carries the 2pi
        factor onto the cartesian q-points. This is consistent with e.g.
        Kittel. The reduced coordinates are always with respect to the
        reciprocal primitive cell.
