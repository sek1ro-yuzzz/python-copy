    """ Renders an image of the viewport's view.

        :param size: A pair of integers specifying the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the output image in pixels.
        :param int frame: The animation frame to render. Numbering starts at 0. See the :py:attr:`Pipeline.num_frames <ovito.pipeline.Pipeline.num_frames>` property for the number of loaded animation frames.
        :param str filename: The file path under which the rendered image should be saved (optional).
                             Supported output formats are: :file:`.png`, :file:`.jpeg`, and :file:`.tiff`.
        :param background: A triplet of RGB components in the range [0,1] specifying the background color of the rendered image (unless *alpha* is set).
        :param alpha: This option makes the background transparent so that the rendered image may later be superimposed on a different backdrop.
                      When using this option, make sure to save the image in the PNG format in order to preserve the generated transparency information.
        :param renderer: The rendering engine to use. If set to ``None``, either OpenGL or Tachyon are used,
                         depending on the availability of OpenGL in the current execution context.
        :param crop: This option cuts away border areas of the rendered image filled with the background color; the resulting image may thus turn out smaller than the requested *size*.
        :param layout: Optional definition of a :ref:`multi-viewport layout <manual:viewport_layouts>` to be rendered into the output image. The layout must be provided as a list of :py:class:`Viewport` objects
                       and corresponding rectangular areas, which determine where each viewport's picture appears within the composed output image.
                       Please make use of OVITO Pro's :ref:`code generation <manual:python_code_generation>` function to learn how to construct the *layout* argument.
        :param stop_on_error: Controls whether the rendering process should be aborted by raising an exception in case an error occurs in any of the scene's data pipelines.
        :returns: A `QImage <https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/PySide6/QtGui/QImage.html>`__ object containing the rendered picture.

        **Populating the scene**

        Before rendering an image using this method, you should make sure the three-dimensional contains some
        visible objects. Typically this involves calling the :py:meth:`Pipeline.add_to_scene() <ovito.pipeline.Pipeline.add_to_scene>`
        method on a pipeline to insert its output data into the scene::

           pipeline = import_file('simulation.dump')
           pipeline.add_to_scene()

        **Selecting the rendering backend**

        OVITO supports several different rendering backends for producing pictures of the three-dimensional scene:

            * :py:class:`OpenGLRenderer` (default)
            * :py:class:`TachyonRenderer`
            * :py:class:`OSPRayRenderer`

        Each of these backends exhibits specific parameters that control the image quality and other aspect of the image
        generation process. Typically, you would create an instance of one of these renderer classes, configure it and pass
        it to the :py:meth:`!render_image()` method:

        .. literalinclude:: ../example_snippets/viewport_select_renderer.py
           :lines: 5-

        **Post-processing images**

        If the ``filename`` parameter is omitted, the method does not save the rendered image to disk.
        This gives you the opportunity to paint additional graphics on top before saving the
        `QImage <https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide6/QtGui/QImage.html>`__ later using its ``save()`` method:

        .. literalinclude:: ../example_snippets/render_to_image.py

        As an alternative to the direct method demonstrated above, you can also make use of a :py:class:`PythonViewportOverlay`
        to paint custom graphics on top of rendered images.
