    Base: :py:class:`traits.has_traits.HasTraits`

    Abstract base class for :ref:`custom viewport overlays <writing_custom_viewport_overlays>` written in Python.

    When you write a new viewport overlay, you must implement the :py:meth:`render` method, which gets called by the system each time a
    :py:class:`Viewport` window is being rendered:

    .. literalinclude:: ../example_snippets/viewport_overlay_interface.py
        :lines: 5-9

    If you are working with OVITO Pro, you can :ref:`add your overlay to one of the interactive viewport windows <manual:viewport_layers.python_script>`.
    If you are writing a standalone Python program to render images or movies using the :py:meth:`Viewport.render_image` and :py:meth:`Viewport.render_anim`
    methods, you need to add your overlay to the viewport's :py:attr:`~Viewport.overlays` or :py:attr:`~Viewport.underlays` lists.

    When adding your overlay to one of these lists, the instance must be wrapped in a :py:class:`~ovito.vis.PythonViewportOverlay` object as follows:

            A context manager for creating and rendering a `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`__ figure onto the canvas.

            This method creates a Matplotlib figure and renders it onto the viewport canvas. Inside a `with` statement, you can add various types of plots
            to the Matplotlib figure. The figure is then drawn onto the canvas.

            :param pos: Position of the anchor point for placing the figure on the canvas. The origin (0,0) is in the lower left corner of the canvas, (1,1) in the upper right.
            :param size: Size of the figure in relative viewport canvas coordinates, specified as a tuple *(width, height)*.
            :param anchor: Position of the anchor point relative to the figure bounds. Must be one of ``"center"``, ``"north west"``, ``"west"``, ``"south west"``, ``"south"``, ``"south east"``, ``"east"``, ``"north east"``, ``"north"``.
            :param font_scale: Scaling factor applied to the fonts in the figure. Useful for adjusting the text size of axis labels.
            :param alpha: Transparency level of the figure background. A value of 0.0 makes the background fully transparent, while 1.0 makes it opaque.
            :param tight_layout: Controls whether to automatically adjust subplot parameters for a "tight" layout.
            :return: A generator yielding a `Matplotlib figure <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure>`__. The figure is automatically closed and copied to the canvas after the generator exits.

            **Example**

            Create a Matplotlib figure, plot some data dynamically calculated by a :py:class:`~ovito.modifiers.HistogramModifier` as part of a data pipeline,
            and render it onto the viewport canvas:

            .. literalinclude:: ../example_snippets/viewport_overlay_interface.py
                :lines: 65-74

            .. note::

                To use the :py:meth:`mpl_figure` method, you first need to install the `matplotlib` Python module.
                See :ref:`ovitos_install_modules`.
